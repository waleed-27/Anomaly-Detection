# Anomaly Detection

This repository implements anomaly detection techniques on the VisA Dataset to identify anomalies within PCB classes.

## Project Overview

- **Preprocessing**: The VisA dataset was preprocessed to prepare it for anomaly detection tasks.
  
- **Models Used**: State-of-the-art anomaly detection models such as Cflow and DiffusionAD were employed to detect anomalies.

- **Evaluation**: Model performance was evaluated using comprehensive metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
